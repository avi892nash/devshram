# Check Translation Files

Please verify that all translation files in `src/translations/` are synchronized:

1. Read both `src/translations/en.json` and `src/translations/hi.json`
2. Compare their structure:
   - Same number of projects
   - Same project categories
   - All required fields present in both
   - Same page sections
3. Report any discrepancies found
4. If discrepancies exist, ask if I should sync them

Focus on structural consistency, not translation accuracy.
